#' Derive Space Adjustment
#'
#' @param tbl A data frame.
#' @param text_indent_reference The reference start point of text indent. Accept `table` or `page_margin`
#'
#' @return a value indicating the amount of space adjustment
#'
#' @section Specification:
#' \if{latex}{
#'  \itemize{
#'    \item Collect page width, page margins and table width attributes from `tbl` object.
#'    \item Convert the attributes from inch to twip using 'inch_to_twip()'.
#'    \item Derive the adjusted space by discounting page margins and table width from page width, then divided by 2.
#'    \item Set the adjusted space to 0 if previous derivation returns to negative value.
