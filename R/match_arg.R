#' Argument Verification Using Partial Matching
#'
#' Similar to `match.arg()`, match_arg matches `arg` against a table of candidate values as specified by `choices`.
#'
#' @details This function resolves errors from `match.arg()` with '' as arg input.
#' @inheritParams base::match.arg
#' @section Specification:
#' \if{latex}{
#'  \itemize{
#'    \item Convert arg and choices inputs from numeric to characters.
#'    \item Input choices imputation if it is missing.
#'    \item Input arg imputation if it is NULL.
#'    \item Input several.ok check for arg length.
#'    \item Compare arg with choices values and report error message if it does not match.
#'  }
#'  }
#' \if{html}{The contents of this section are shown in PDF user manual only.}
#'
#' @return The matched elements of arg or in case of match failure a detailed error message
